### Welcome to Chez Blair! 

We just started a food truck and couldn't be more excited to present our new menu to you via online application. 

### Instructions:

Much of the ordering system is straightforward. 

* Select a menu category.
* Select a menu item from the category.
* Enter the quantity of that item you would like to order.
* Keep adding items to your order by selecing (Y), or get your order total by selecting (N).

Our program will store and sum your order for you. 
..but don't forget to give us 5 stars on google!

-- Special note --
much of this code was not originally authored by me but provided as a working example for the class I am taking. For more specifics on the original source please contact me.
